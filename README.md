===============

Downloads all images from a 4chan thread and preserves the original file name.

This program is designed to work with the new domain changes that have been done to work with the new domains that 4chan saves images to.

It's written in C# and targets the .NET 4.0.

Feel free to whatever the fuck you want with it, but I am not responsible for *anything* that this program does, or what you do with this program.
Use at your own risk.
